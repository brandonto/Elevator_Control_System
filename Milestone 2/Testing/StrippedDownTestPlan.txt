Stripped Down Elevator System Test Plan
***************************************

***************************************
CentralCoordinator+LocalController
***************************************
1. Place Probe on insideButton port of centralOp
2. Insert signal for insideButton

Test Case 1
===========
Press button

1. Inject insideButton

Expected Result:
LocalOp state goes from idle to floorButtonRequest, to moving
CentralOp state goes from idle to handleRequest

***************************************
Local Controller+Motor
***************************************
1. Place Probe on motorS port of motorR1
2. Insert signals for moveUp, moveDown, stop
3. Open state diagram for motor.

Test Case 1
===========
Turn On elevator motor in up direction

1. Inject motorUp signal while state is in idle

Expected result:
transistion from idle to movingUp state

Test Case 2
===========
Stop Elevator while moving in any direction

1. Inject stop signal while motor is in movingUp or movingDown state

Expected result:
transition from movingUp or movingDown to idle

Test Case 3
===========
Try to switch directions without coming to a stop first

1. Inject motorUp signal while motor is in movingDown state (or motorDown in movingUp)

Expected Result:
Nothing happens
