  			Central Coordinator
	----------------------------------------------
Test Case #1:
1. Send a FButtonUp.pressed() signal to the Central Coordinator at its initial state.
2. Add a probe to make sure it receives the signal and dispatch an Elevator for the request.

Test Case #2:
1. Send a FButtonDown.pressed() signal to the Central Coordinator at its initial state.
2. Add a probe to make sure it receives the signal and dispatch an Elevator for the request.

Test Case #3:
1. Send two FButtonUp.pressed() signals to the Central Coordinator at its initial state.
2. Add a probe to make sure both the requests are being served (two elevators got dispatched).
3. While the Elevators are moving up, send another FButtonUp.pressed() signal along its path.
4. Add a probe to make sure it receives the signal and dispatch an Elevator for the request.

Test Case #4:
1. Send two FButtonDown.pressed() signals to the Central Coordinator at its initial state.
2. Add a probe to make sure both the requests are being served (two elevators got dispatched).
3. While the Elevators are moving down, send another FButtonDown.pressed() signal along its path.
4. Add a probe to make sure it receives the signal and dispatch an Elevator for the request.

Test Case #5:
1. Send two FButtonUp.pressed() signals to the Central Coordinator at its initial state.
2. Add a probe to make sure both the requests are being served (two elevators got dispatched).
3. While the Elevators are moving up, send a FButtonDown.pressed() signal along its path.
4. Add a probe to the request queue to make sure the signal is received and pending.
5. Add another probe to ensure no dispatch signal will be sent until one of the elevator is
done with the request.

Test Case #6:
1. Send two FButtonDown.pressed() signals to the Central Coordinator at its initial state.
2. Add a probe to make sure both the requests are being served (two elevators got dispatched).
3. While the Elevators are moving down, send a FButtonUp.pressed() signal along its path.
4. Add a probe to the request queue to make sure the signal is received and pending.
5. Add another probe to ensure no dispatch signal will be sent until one of the elevator is
done with the request.
