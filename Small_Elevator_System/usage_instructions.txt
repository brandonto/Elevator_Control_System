// Usage instructions
//

1. The number of elevators and number of floor are configurable by changing the
   NUM_ELEVATORS and NUM_FLOORS constants in the Constants class.

2. After configuring those, build and run the system.

3. Click on the play button to start the system.

4. Insert probes on the protocols that start with a U (User). These are the
   user interface to the system. Do not probe any ports that don't start with
   a U, as these other ports are used by the system itself.

- For ElevatorButton, insert a probe on the UEBPort (User-ElevatorButton).

		These signals represent pressing the buttons inside the elevator.

- For ElevatorDoorButton, insert a probe on the UEDBPort (User-ElevatorDoorButton).
    Index 0 = close, Index 1 = open.

		These signals represent pressing the door buttons inside the elevator

- For FloorButton, insert a prove on the UFBPort (User-FloorButton).
    Index 0 = down, Index 1 = up.

		These signals represent pressing the button on the floor.

- For DoorSensor, insert a probe on the UDSPort (User-DoorSensor).

		These signals represent impeding the door from closing

- For LocalController, insert a probe on the ULPort (User-LocalController).

		These signals represent triggering the emergency brakes under certain
		circumstances

5. Send signals according to your needs.
